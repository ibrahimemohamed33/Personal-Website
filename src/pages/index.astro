      Hey, welcome to my website! Iâ€™m a data engineer at Acorns and located in the D.C. area.

      My goal is to build software that benefits peoples' lives, where we can leave time for everyone 
      to spend with their loved ones and pursue their creative interests. 
      I enjoy solving complex problems that reveal the deep inner workings of the universe and 
      doing the impossible when assessing human behavior.

      Before coming back to the D.C. area, I was a student at the University of Chicago. I majored in math and took a variety of computer science classes. As I exposed myself to topics in computer science, I realized that I enjoyed solving problems outside the scope of pure math and inside the scopes of applied CS. I also came to understand that producers, ranging from your local shop to big corporations, can only benefit consumers if they leverage the right data to make the right insights. I gravitated towards data-driven roles and found data engineering to have unique problems that required wearing many hats.

      My switch from math to computer science also stems from my three internships at Microsoft Whiteboard, where I worked on enhancing the product's canvas and backend integration with Microsoft Teams. I was responsible for leveraging complicated affine transformations to develop a proper outline of the board's geometry feature, which further exposed me to the full-stack mindset when solving problems in software engineering. I also developed a feature to significantly simplify the workflow for Whiteboard users that came from Teams.

      My interests do not stop at STEM, however, and often expand into topics in philosophy; public transit; constitutional law; ancient and medieval history; business management; and political theory. When I'm not at work, you'll see me playing basketball, reading anything I can get my hands on, learning languages, listening to Arabic music, or volunteering for cats or labor unions.
