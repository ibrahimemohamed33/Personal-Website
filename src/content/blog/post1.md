The song Asheq el Rooh by Muhammad Abdel Wahab is one that, at first glance, seems to contradict the comedic atmosphere of the movie _Ghazal Al Binaat_ (The Flirtation of Girls). The film portrays, with all its jokes and laughter, that the love Mr. Hamaam feels for his (college-aged) student, Laila, is unrequited given their age differences. Hamaam is subconsciously aware of this fact but refuses to accept it. To him, Laila was the first person to show him joy in a life that felt miserable. He was poor and resentful towards the world because bad luck was an omnipresent force in his life. The song, with a title translating to “the passion of the soul,” or as we’d say “soulmate” in English, talks about love. There is a sense of dramatic irony that comes with Abdel Wahab’s song since he does not know anything about Hamaam’s or Laila’s situation. Yet, the audience knows he alludes to Hamaam’s love for Laila when the two eavesdrop into Abdel Wahab’s performance.
What sets this song apart from other love songs is that Abdel Wahab sings about showing love by accepting the heartbreak of letting someone go, finding joy in their happiness. Abdel Wahab discusses in his interviews how he was inspired by some main themes within the Quran. Namely, how one should search within their heart or soul to find love even if their current emotions evoke other feelings. The lyrics resonated so well with the cast that Hamaam’s tears in the film were genuine, as Abdel Wahab later talks about.
Abdel Wahab sings about his sweetheart leaving him despite sacrificing his life for her happiness. He emphasizes the inconsolable pain of losing someone he loved. And how sleepless nights were filled with tears. Moreover, he loves to invoke the double-meaning of his eyes while following the tendency in Arabic poetry to refer to a person’s lover as their eyes. When you love someone they bring a new pair of eyes to the world that changes your opinion of yourself and the world around you. They make you see the world in a better way and bring a beam of light to the dark world. Similarly, when you lose someone, as with losing your eyes, you cannot see the world in the same state it once was. 
Abdel Wahab begins the song in a deep state of sadness as he laments the loss of his loved one. But as we progress throughout the song we notice he comes to terms with this loss. We start seeing the beauty of this song in how it changes course from following the stereotypes of most heartbreak songs, to moving towards acceptance. He believes that if one truly loves someone, no matter how painful it is to lose them, one must let them go so they can enjoy their life the way they want. And that while we are inclined to want them to stay, these (selfish) feelings are transient compared to the infinite love that comes from our soul. This song is truly a work of art. Moreover, it brought a great ending to the last film for one of Egypt’s infamous actors: Naguib Rihaani.

## My translation of the lyrics:
Why, why, why,
why O eye[his eye] are my nights so long?
Why, why, why, why my eye are my tears flowing?
O my eyes[his lover], my sweetheart why did you abandon me?
Why can she[his lover] sleep but you are awake, O my eyes why why?
O night, my eye, I complained during my insomniac nights
And O night, the cup in my hand is filled with the tears of my eye,
And how many times do I wake up in the early mornings and my promises wake me up
And even the eye suddenly(?) wakes up with tears on my cheeks 
to the person who preoccupies my mind, 
the one who takes me away from [playing a sad song] on my broken oud.

I sacrificed my life for her
And I will only live on in her memory
I sacrificed my life for her
And I will only live on in her memory

I’m visiting her world, like day and night
And everything has happened and you’re not [doing things] in my favor
And you’re forgetting about me [while I feel like] I’m next to you
I really tried to confess my love and complain and get closer for you [to hear] my complaints
And I found you in the high sky,
And I’m on the ground, where I couldn’t reach you

So I embraced my complaint in my heart and weaned off my soul from your door
I desired love in a temple built by my soul and my being
And I left hope as a monk [for] I have no other hope
And I’m lighting a candle for others and the candle’s light burns in my embrace
And I sell my soul for the sake of my soul
And I am satisfied with my deprivation
For the love of the soul will never end, 
but the love of the flesh passes
The love of the soul will never end, but the love of the flesh passes
